You may think that a drug test that is 100% accurate for true positives (detecting somebody who is a user) is pretty good, but what if it also has 1% false positive rate (indicating somebody is a user when they're not)? And furthermore, the rate of drug use in the population at large (and thus our prior belief) is 1/200.\n",

If we have the same individual who tested positive the first time take the drug test a second time then the posterior probability from our the first test becomes our new prior during the second application. What is the probability that a person is a drug user after two positive drug tests in a row?\n",
